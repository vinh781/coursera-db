For the product or service that you envisioned with the first assignment on business modelling, what is the (1) Core Benefit, (2) Actual Product or Service, and (3) Augmented Products or Services? (Please respond in approximately 250 words).",
      "definition": "The core product acts as a basis for the tangible product (which is the extra benefits that differentiate the product from its competitors) and the augmented product, which also includes peripheral benefits such as after-sales service, helplines or even training in the use of the product. Actual Product level When understanding the customers' needs, the wants -specific requirements to match the needs- can be co-created. By opening up the product development process, integrating iterative feedback loops and involving external stakeholders will achieve increased effectiveness and lowered costs. Customization kicks in when a 'standard'/basic product is being delivered where customers can personalize the output to its own refined wants. This furthers the perception of the experience in a positive way. Augmented Product level Also on this level, customization (output) personalizes additional features and benefits all adapted to the requirements of the customer. Prior to the output, as within the Actual Product, defining and co-creating the additional features and benefits increases effectiveness and value."

A board of directors gives you access to expertise, provided you choose them wisely, but at the cost of giving up control of the business to them. Technically, the officers of a corporation report to the board of directors, who bear the ultimate responsibility for the proper management of the company. A board of advisors is a less-formal entity. You can have the same kind of people on an advisory board, but you don't report to them nor do they have the same power as a board of directors.

      "term": "How would you define the \"entrepreneurial mindset\"? Be sure to discuss each of the five factors. Please respond in one to two paragraphs. | ",
      "definition": "Entrepreneurial mindset has five factors. They are; high need for achievement, individualism, locus of control focus, and optimism. Need for achievement is defined as having a preference for challenge, an acceptance of personal responsibility for outcomes, and a personal drive for accomplishment. Individualism means that entrepreneurs need less support or approval from others. High individualism is associated with an emphasis on individual initiative and achievement. Often results in entrepreneurs needing less support or approval from others. Control has two segments, which is autonomy and locus of control. Autonomy is an individual's belief about their level of freedom from the influence of others. Locus of control is an individual's belief that they can influence the environment in which they are found. People with higher levels of autonomy and an internal locus on control are more likely to discover an entrepreneurial opportunity. Internally-oriented locus of control people believed that they are able to influence their environment. Successful entrepreneurs are able to focus attention on a single task and see it through to completion. This leads selected individuals to react and to become successful entrepreneurs. While optimism enables entrepreneurs to try new things and attempt difficult tasks, optimism may also present negative impacts. Optimism leads entrepreneurs to frequently make judgements on subjective positive factors."

      "term": "In considering the role of \"risk\" in entrepreneurial decision-making, why do entrepreneurs accept risks that traditional managers may avoid? Please respond in one paragraph. | ",
      "definition": "Entrepreneurs engage in risk that traditional managers may avoid because they have intuition, have individualistic view, have high tolerance for ambiguity and high confidence in skills, knowledge, and expertise.

They have high tolerance for ambiguity based on comfort with making difficult choices with in complement information in the past. And lastly they have high confidence in skills, knowledge, and expertise enhanced based on past success. Entrepreneurs engage in risk that traditional managers may avoid because they lack in necessary information in a situation needing prompt decision. They develop an inside view of the decisions they face. They also ignore elements of past situations. And they favor positive possible outcomes over negative outcomes. Entrepreneurs assess real risk and improve decision-making by using the following keys. They apply multiple perspectives to a decision situation, they integrate these perspectives into the decision, they use a complex cognitive framework regarding a decision situation, and they have broader and deeper view of the decision at hand which may result in a more accurate assessment of risk."
